#### Private Tutoring (2017 - Present)

I provide private tutoring for university level mathematics students from undergraduate to postgraduate level. I also tutor some some physics and computer sciences topics as well. Students can contact me through [StudentVIP](https://studentvip.com.au/tutors/10234/max) or via email. I am currently based in Newcastle Australia and can tutor students from the University of Newcastle in person. Students not in the Newcastle area I will tutor via Zoom, including international students.

I can tutor honours/postgraduate level mathematics courses in any areas such as topology, algebra, real/complex/functional/harmonic/Fourier analysis, group theory, measure theory, differential geometry/topology, representation theory, graph theory etc. I may also be able to assist in areas such as theoretical computer science, category theory, algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory and quantum physics, though, I don't have a high level of expertise in these areas. Feel free to contact me about any topics that don't fit under these headings.
