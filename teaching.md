## Teaching

#### Private tutoring (2017 - Present)

I provide private tutoring and mentoring for university level mathematics students studying at postgraduate level (e.g. Master's or PhD level students). Students can contact me through [StudentVIP](https://studentvip.com.au/tutors/10234/max) or via email. I am currently based in Newcastle Australia and can tutor students from The University of Newcastle in person. Students not in the Newcastle area I tutor via Zoom, including students based outside of Australia.

I can tutor postgraduate level mathematics courses in any areas such as topology, algebra, real/complex/functional/harmonic/Fourier analysis, group theory, measure theory, differential geometry/topology, representation theory, graph theory etc. I may also be able to assist in areas such as theoretical computer science, category theory, algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory and quantum physics, though, I don't have a high level of expertise in these areas. Feel free to contact me about any topics that don't fit under these headings.

I am also open to providing free mathematics tutoring in exchange for language lessons (if you speak a language other than English). I'm interested in learning to speak and improve my skills in any of the following languages: German, French, Russian, Greek. Let me know if you speak any of those languages and would be interested in such an exchange.
